A rendition of the classic casino game Blackjack
<br><br>
Rules
<br>
The motive of the game is to beat the dealer by getting a hand of cards where the count is as close to 21 as<br>
possible. The player will start off by selecting a bet of $10, $25, $50 or $100. Once a bet is selected, both the<br>
user and dealer will start off with two cards. The dealer\'s first card will be hidden so the player will only know<br>
the count of one of the dealer\'s cards. The player can then begin their turn by deciding whether they are<br>
satisfied with their card count or not. If the player decides that the card count is too low, they can press HIT<br>
to get a card. If the count of the player\'s hand is over 21, the player will lose right away. Once the player is<br>
satisfied with their hand, they can press STAND to end their turn. Once the player\'s turn ends, the dealer\'s<br>
hidden card will be revealed. Here on, the dealer will decide whether or not to draw more cards or not. If<br>
the dealer\'s count is higher than the player\'s count, the dealer will win. If both the dealer and player end with<br>
the same card count, the result will be a push. (a draw) Else, if the dealer\'s count is lower than the player\'s<br>
count, the player will win.<br>
